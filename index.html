<p>In two minutes’ time, at 7:30, you might have been about to sit down in a theatre ready to watch a play, but things have changed. It’s 7:28, or any time other than 7:30, so what happens next?</p>

<p><em>7:28</em> is an online treasure hunt across the internet — solve the riddle, unlock the next video, and jump into a new world. <em>7:28</em> is about comfort, contentment and feeling connected.
