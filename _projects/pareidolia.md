synopsis: |
  Three people have decided to say something. Something important to them, supposedly. But things are going wrong (and it’s not just their internet bandwidth).

  > No matter how hard they try they can’t agree on a way to say it.<br>
  > No matter how hard they try they can’t seem to do it right, the way they planned.<br>
  > And no matter how hard they try: Z can’t help but be a Tennyson poem, X can’t help but be a Russian antihero, and Y can’t help but be the world of L. Frank Baum.

  Things are going to have to change.
