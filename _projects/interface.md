synopsis: |
  Bella, Marcus and Danni struggle to communicate through the digital isolation theyâ€™ve found themselves trapped in. Bella tries to help two desperate customers; Marcus watches the people he loves slip by; and Danni finds a hole inside her that absorbs her most precious memories. In the midst of their distorted world, the three attempt to break through the endless streams of media that corrupt their existence.

  INTERFACE _explores the facets of human beings who are desperate to have one real, tangible conversation before they are swept away entirely by our devastating obsession with technology._
